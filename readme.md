The article https://habr.com/ru/articles/926214/ listed three interview test samples.
I was curious to try them myself, since I haven't interviewed in a long time


## **Benchmark**
The *Benchmark* project is designed to measure the algorithm's performance (execution speed) and memory usage.

## **Tests**
The *Tests* project contains test cases to verify the correctness of the algorithm.

## **Sandbox**
The *Sandbox* project contains the actual algorithm implementation.

### **MergeArrays**
Given two sorted integer arrays (ascending order), possibly of different lengths, merge them into a single sorted array without duplicates, using only constant extra memory.

### **Keyboard**
Keyboard is broken:
- When he presses `b`, it deletes the last lowercase letter entered.
- When he presses `B`, it deletes the last uppercase letter entered.
All other keys work normally.

Given a string consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters (representing the sequence of key presses), determine the final output.

### **SubArrays**
Given an array of non-negative integers, find a contiguous subarray with the maximum sum where there are **no more than two distinct numbers**. Return the sum.

**Example:**
`[10, 10, 5, 5]` → Valid (only two distinct numbers: `10` and `5`).
